# Smart Pricing Model

# I. Project Overview
The Smart Pricing Model is designed to integrate your coffee shop's inventory, customers, and transactions into a simple centralized system to streamline operations. This application offers features such as time-based pricing adjustments, analysis of previous transactions, and login pages for administrative purposes, allowing users to add, edit, or delete menu items. This not only allows shop owners to modify their prices according to demand but also organizes the sales and customer records and inventory to a certain extent.

The system fundamentally utilizes a MySQL database to manage important data such as customer details, transaction histories, and flexible pricing tables. Its design organizes key records into separate tables, including SmartPricing, Customers, Purchases, and TransactionHistory. This structure facilitates easy data access and updates, creating a robust backend to enhance a smooth user experience. The user interface is very engaging, featuring elements like login verification, a responsive menu, and forms tailored for specific actions such as adding or removing items. The dynamic pricing functionality is especially creative, as it modifies prices according to set time multipliers (morning, afternoon, evening), mirroring changes in real-world demand. This allows coffee shop owners to optimize profits during busy periods while efficiently managing their inventory. The Smart Pricing Model is a perfect fit for small to medium-sized coffee shops that want to embrace technology in their operations. Its dynamic pricing feature meets the needs of today’s consumers, and the database-driven design guarantees that it can grow with your business while remaining dependable. Plus, it’s easy to learn, allowing for a quick transition that boosts efficiency and gives store owners important insights into their day-to-day activities. 

With features such as dynamic pricing, inventory management, and thorough record-keeping, this system makes everyday tasks easier while opening doors for growth. It helps you boost revenue during busy times, manage stock to cut down on waste, and gain insights into what your customers prefer. This system truly addresses the practical needs of entrepreneurs who are eager to improve their businesses. In the end, it’s a move towards creating a smarter and more sustainable future for small business owners, one cup of coffee at a time
